## Course Overview and Goals
This course explores both the production and the preservation of digital culture in the context of the United States. It begins by tracing the computerization of American life over the second half of the twentieth century, looking at how actors in the past understood digital technologies and their future possibilities in a wide variety of contexts. How did scientists, bankers, government workers, business managers, filmmakers, urban planners, librarians, archivists, and the like make sense of, and explain to themselves, the growing role of digital technologies within American society? How did technological changes in professional arenas spill into the domestic realm and change interpersonal relations? And, for our current-day purposes, what are the physical remains - whether hardware, software or media-based - that we can expect to have survived into the present from these entanglements with technology? As the United States underwent its transformation into an information-intensive economy, what are the persistent representations of information culture that remain for us to preserve today? What unique problems do these forms and formats present to archivists and related information professionals? What are the tools that information professionals use to maintain digital objects over the long term?

With these questions as our starting point, this course offers a historical and theoretical framework for understanding the preservation of digital culture, including both digitized and born-digital materials. As our exploration moves toward the present day, we encounter contemporary information management problems and solutions - solutions that must also take into consideration the technological shifts that took place over the previous seventy years. Mastering the latest research on the preservation problems surrounding digital technology is the goal of the course. Along the way, this course tackles the ongoing debates focused on the related but distinct concepts of preservation, curation, maintenance, and stewardship. 

## Course Requirements

### Assignment, % of Final Grade, Due Date 

* Policy Analysis (Institutional Audience), 25%, February 21st, noon
* Public Service Announcement (Lay Audience), 25%, March 21st, noon
* Archive-It Presentation and Report (Professional Audience), 25%, Presentation: April 15th, during class & Report: April 18th, noon

### Student Working Groups (SWG's)
Every student will be assigned into a working group at the start of the term. Each working group will focus on a major theme running through the LIS 2674 course material. The purpose of these working groups is to simulate the topic- and problem-specific project teams commonly used to conduct research and produce deliverables within the information professions. Each class session will feature a discussion component. In some weeks, the entire class will engage in discussion as a single body. In other weeks, students will meet with their SWG to discuss the group's research agenda. In still other weeks, the SWG's will be intermixed to facilitate cross-topic discussions. The following areas of focus have been chosen for Spring 2014:

* Workplace Transformations
* Innovation and Sustainability
* Efficiencies and Expenses
* Makers and Users
* Boosterism and Alarmism

Active participation in your assigned SWG will form the basis for your course participation grade. You should read and critically analyze all assigned course materials before coming to class, arrive prepared to report to your fellow students, and work over the duration of the term to develop a unique expertise in your SWG subject area. 

**At the end of the semester, you are also required to submit a 250-500 word statement that uses professional and collegial prose to identify the strongest and/or most valuable individual member and the weakest and/or least valuable individual member of your SWG, explaining the rationale behind your choices.** The purpose of this exercise is to simulate peer review and performance evaluation. These statements will inform the instructor's evaluation of your individual classroom performance but will not serve as the sole criteria for the grade.

## Assignments: 

LIS2674 has three major assignments. The assignments are designed to develop your skills in communicating with distinct and various audiences.  

### Assignment 1: **Policy Analysis (Institutional audience; 6-8 pages)** 

The purpose of this assignment is to expose you to the institutional and administrative aspects of digital stewardship. By comparing different institutional policies, or by comparing policies to audit criteria, you will gain a better understanding of the institution-level aspects of preserving digital content such as governance, organizational structure, staffing, financial sustainability, workflow and process development, and the alliance of policy to institutional mission.

Closely review a set of digital preservation policies from one of the three groups below and write a 2000-2500 word report comparing these policies. You can review 3 policies and compare them against each other or you can choose 2 overall policies and compare them to the Trustworthy Repositories Audit & Certification (TRAC) criteria. If you choose a web archiving or digital forensics policy/process, it should be compared to a policy in the same group (i.e. web archiving compared to web archiving, digital forensics to digital forensics, etc.).

If you choose to compare policies to other policies, your report should describe:  

* Which policies you selected and what each policy reflected of the nature and scope of its collecting and preservation activities.
* A brief summary of what each policy covered.
* What were the similarities and differences of the policies you examined?
* What elements were unique about each policy?
* Did the policies cover any aspects of digital preservation that you did not expect to see? If so, describe.
* Did the policies not cover any aspects of digital preservation that you were expecting to see? If so, describe.  

If you choose to compare policies to the TRAC audit criteria, your report should describe:  

* Which policies you selected and what each policy reflected of the nature and scope of its collecting and preservation activities.
* A brief summary of what each policy covered.
* A detailed analysis of which TRAC criteria were covered.
* A summary of which TRAC criteria were not covered and thoughts on why this might be the case.

**TRAC Audit Criteria:**

A summary of the TRAC audit criteria can be found here: <http://www.crl.edu/archiving-preservation/digital-archives/metrics-assessing-and-certifying/trac>. 

The full TRAC guidelines can be found here (checklist summaries start on pg. 59): <http://www.crl.edu/sites/default/files/attachments/pages/trac_0.pdf>.

**Digital Preservation Policies:**

Links to 33 different institutional policies can be found in this post on the Library of Congress's blog, The Signal: <http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2013/08/analysis-of-current-digital-preservation-policies-archives-libraries-and-museums/>.

Additional ones can be found here: <http://wiki.opf-labs.org/display/SP/Published+Preservation+Policies>.

**Digital Forensics:**

"The Way We Do it Here": Mapping Digital Forensics Workflows in Collecting Institutions" by Martin Gengenbach contains interview and workflow diagrams of the digital forensics/acquisition process from eight different institutions. The full paper can be found here: <http://digitalcurationexchange.org/system/files/gengenbach-forensic-workflows-2012.pdf>.

### Assignment 2: **Public Service Announcement, "Obsolescence and You" (Lay audience; 4 minutes)**  

Building on your research in Assignment 1, create a web-based presentation lasting no more than 4 minutes that explains to the residents of Pittsburgh why they should have a digital preservation strategy and outlines the benefits of having long-term access to the their digital materials. In this presentation, you should use the larger history of digital culture as presented in class to teach your audience about the concept of obsolescence and how it relates to digital preservation. If you have not previously created a web-based presentation, such as a web-based video, slideshow or webinar, numerous online resources can be located via Google or ULS. It must be posted on the open web (YouTube, Vimeo, Tumblr and such are all fine, Facebook and other member-restricted sites are not). You will submit the link on CourseWeb by the stated due date. 

### Assignment 3: **Archive-It Report and Presentation  (Professional audience; 10-12 pages and 15 minutes)**  

In this assignment, each SWG will use the Internet Archive's web archiving tool Archive-It to harvest websites and build a small test collection. After receiving training on Archive-It, you will choose 4 websites to harvest for building your collection. You will then run test crawls, analyze the results, scope your harvesting, run production crawls, perform quality assurance, and present on the overall results of the project.

Your report and final presentation will cover the following topics: 

* What is the theme of your collection? By what criteria did you appraise and select websites (domains, subdomains, specific pages, etc.) for inclusion in your collection?
*What surprises did you encounter in your test crawls? What sort of content and file types did your crawls return? What problems as far as acquisition did you discover? 
* Discuss how you went about scoping your collection between the test and production crawls.
* Discuss using Archive-It. How do specific functionalities of the tool tie into your work? How does it support specific parts of acquisition, scoping, and access? What did you like or find confusing about using it?
* What recommendations would you give to someone taking over future management of this collection? Were this test crawling for an institution exploring the possibility of starting a web archiving program, what would you advise for further investigation?
* Lastly, discuss how the assignment ties into the broader issues of preserving digital culture that we have investigated over the semester. What thematic issues of digital stewardship does web archiving highlight? How does this tie into your SWG theme?

For the presentation, your SWG will be in charge of deciding everything about how you present your project. You can record something ahead of time, you can perform a group presentation, you can elect only one person to do all of the talking, you may dance your presentation—it does not matter, so long as the presentation lasts for 15 minutes and it achieves the goal of presenting the problem, method, and results of your project. You will be evaluated on the ability to convey this information, not on conforming to a format requirement.
