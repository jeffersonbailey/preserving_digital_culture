# About

This repository contains a collection of resources related to the class *Preserving Digital Culture*  (LIS 2674 in ye olde coursebook) co-taught by Jefferson Bailey and Alison Langmead, with assistance by James King, in Spring 2014 semester in the Masters of Library and Information Science (MLIS) program, in the Archives and Information Science specialization, in the School of Information Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. This class took place on the North American tectonic plate of the planet Earth.

## Contents

Contained in this repository are the class syllabus, some additional assignment information including post-class reflections on the intentions and "goods and bads" of each assignment (from my perspective), and some assignment guidelines that came out of student questions. Also included here (eventually) are resources, links, exercises, and walkthroughs related to the two tool-oriented, hands-on "lab" sessions/classes. I will add the actual labs exercises as I refine them for the cyber-ether and not the classroom. 

Included in the class_assignments docs are links to some of the collections and other materials created by students as part of a couple of the assignments. I will also add other stuff that is possibly, but not necessarily, related. Feedback, input, praise, or denunciation are all welcomed (ideally all of them, via email) and feel free to reuse these materials if useful, except as part of any post-graduate certificate program, because, in my opinion, those are lame.

Please let it be known that, on occasion, during the course of the class, I had to interact with a LMS (Learning Management System) that often made me question my belief in technology and, indeed, society.
