# About

This repository contains a collection of resources related to the class *Preserving Digital Culture*  (LIS 2674 in ye olde coursebook) co-taught by Jefferson Bailey and Alison Langmead, with teaching assistance by James Knight, in Spring 2014 semester in the Masters of Library and Information Science (MLIS) program, in the Archives and Information Science specialization, in the School of Information Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. This class took place on the North American tectonic plate of the planet Earth.

## Contents

Contained in this repository will be the class syllabus, some additional assignment guidelines that came out of student questions, and resources, guidance, links, and walkthroughs related to the two tool-oriented, hands-on "lab" sessions/classes. I will add the actual labs exercise as I refine them for the cyber-ether and not the classroom. 

I will also include links to some of the collections and other materials created by students as part of their assignments. I will also add other stuff that is possibly, but not necessarily, related.

Please let it be known that, on occasion, during the course of the class, I had to interact with a LMS (Learning Management System) that often made me question my belief in technology and, indeed, humanity.
