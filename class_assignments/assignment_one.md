# Assignment 1 Review

## The Objectives
The general idea for the assignment was that policies would give people a quick-and-dirty (and somewhat challenging) introduction to how institutions articulate their digital preservation goals and activities. Having students compare policies lets them see not just that there is no one standard format or content in a digpres policy, but also that the length, focus, and comprehensiveness of these documents can vary widely (and wildly) institution to institution. Allowing comparison of policies to the TRAC checklist was intended as a potential fallback for those daunted by the idea of jumping in and analyzing and comparing policy documents so early in the semester (Week 5). Students did require some guidance about how to frame the "comparison" part of the assignment but overall the papers were quite impressive. I didn't expect anyone to pick the digital forensics topic (since it would require the most granular comparison) but a few did and produced great work. 

## The Good
Assignment 1 turned out better than expected, with some fantastic student papers. I was very impressed with the class's ability to summarize policies, recognized their strengths and deficiencies, tease out the nuances of things like audience or content under stewardship, and compare them to each other and/or to TRAC.

## The Bad
Nothing too bad. Some students compared policies to each other and to TRAC and some picked from multiple categories and compared to each other instead of just comparing multiple policies within each group. Probably needs extra clarity in the assignment text in the future.

## The Outcomes
Student papers - not public.

# Assignment 1 Original Text

## Assignment 1: **Policy Analysis (Institutional audience; 6-8 pages)** 

The purpose of this assignment is to expose you to the institutional and administrative aspects of digital stewardship. By comparing different institutional policies, or by comparing policies to audit criteria, you will gain a better understanding of the institution-level aspects of preserving digital content such as governance, organizational structure, staffing, financial sustainability, workflow and process development, and the alliance of policy to institutional mission.

Closely review a set of digital preservation policies from one of the three groups below and write a 2000-2500 word report comparing these policies. You can review 3 policies and compare them against each other or you can choose 2 overall policies and compare them to the Trustworthy Repositories Audit & Certification (TRAC) criteria. If you choose a web archiving or digital forensics policy/process, it should be compared to a policy in the same group (i.e. web archiving compared to web archiving, digital forensics to digital forensics, etc.).

If you choose to compare policies to other policies, your report should describe:  

* Which policies you selected and what each policy reflected of the nature and scope of its collecting and preservation activities.
* A brief summary of what each policy covered.
* What were the similarities and differences of the policies you examined?
* What elements were unique about each policy?
* Did the policies cover any aspects of digital preservation that you did not expect to see? If so, describe.
* Did the policies not cover any aspects of digital preservation that you were expecting to see? If so, describe.  

If you choose to compare policies to the TRAC audit criteria, your report should describe:  

* Which policies you selected and what each policy reflected of the nature and scope of its collecting and preservation activities.
* A brief summary of what each policy covered.
* A detailed analysis of which TRAC criteria were covered.
* A summary of which TRAC criteria were not covered and thoughts on why this might be the case.

**TRAC Audit Criteria:**

**Digital Preservation Policies:**

**Digital Forensics:**

"The Way We Do it Here": Mapping Digital Forensics Workflows in Collecting Institutions" by Martin Gengenbach contains interview and workflow diagrams of the digital forensics/acquisition process from eight different institutions.
