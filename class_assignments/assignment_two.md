# Assignment 2 Review

## The Objectives
The intent of this assignment is to have students concisely present (visually and verbally) a core concept of digital preservation (this year the idea was "obsolescence") for a general audience. This gets them thinking about how key concepts must be communicated differently to different audience. Also, there's a presentation element, as the videos must be publicly available. 

## The Good
The overall quality was quite strong -- like last year there are a number of PSA video in this batch that... well I don't know if they're ever going to air on television (they're about digital preservation, after all) but they really should!

## The Bad
Not really bad, but one amusing anecdote is that some students, in reviewing last year's PSA videos (also on youtube) failed to remember that we slightly tweaked the intended audience and topic for this year and, thus, in mimicking last year's PSAs, some people ended up doing last year's assignment. Still, all around there are some very well done short digpres/obsolescence videos in this group.

## The Outcomes
Assignment 2 was a hold-over from previous years of the class. We need a better way to aggregate or link to the videos, but most are on youtube and can be found with the text, site, date range in this ugly search query:

# Assignment 2 Original Text

## Assignment 2: **Public Service Announcement, "Obsolescence and You" (Lay audience; 4 minutes)**  

Building on your research in Assignment 1, create a web-based presentation lasting no more than 4 minutes that explains to the residents of Pittsburgh why they should have a digital preservation strategy and outlines the benefits of having long-term access to the their digital materials. In this presentation, you should use the larger history of digital culture as presented in class to teach your audience about the concept of obsolescence and how it relates to digital preservation. If you have not previously created a web-based presentation, such as a web-based video, slideshow or webinar, numerous online resources can be located via Google or ULS. It must be posted on the open web (YouTube, Vimeo, Tumblr and such are all fine, Facebook and other member-restricted sites are not). You will submit the link on CourseWeb by the stated due date.
