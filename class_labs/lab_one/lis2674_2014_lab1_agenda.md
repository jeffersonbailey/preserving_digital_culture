* "Learning Objectives"
  * We will look at the organizational requirements for preserving digital information. The exercise will focus on thinking about the workflows, decision-making, and planning involved in implementing and supporting a digital preservation program in an institutional setting.
  * We will work with data and files to gain a better understanding of the multiple representational states of binary information and the suite of translational occurrences that comprise interacting with digital information. You will also get a better understanding of file formats and embedded metadata.
  * We will gain an understanding of the nature of file fixity and checksums, fixity audits, metadata extraction, and format characterization and validation tools and processes.

### Assignment 1

* Three options: digpres policies, web archiving policies, forensics practices
* Policy docs often in accessible language
* Use as much or as little of documents as possible
* Digital preservation often included in overall preservation policies
* If something is in one document but not in another, that is a feature for comparison. Comparison is not just the evaluation of two equivalents.
* Can be descriptive as well as analytical 
* TRAC, DPC, Score Model as resources
* If you choose one type of policy compare it to similar types
