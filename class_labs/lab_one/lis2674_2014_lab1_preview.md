## Week 5 Lab Preview and Downloads

Hello class! I look forward to meeting everyone on Tuesday, talking about digital preservation, and playing around with some tools that will help us to understand, manipulate, and preserve digital materials. The class will be a mixture of lecture, exercises, demos, and conversation. 

There are a number of goals we hope to achieve by doing hands-on exercises:

* We will look at the organizational requirements for preserving digital information. The exercise will focus on thinking about the workflows, decision-making, and planning involved in implementing and supporting a digital preservation program in an institutional setting.

* We will work with data and files to gain a better understanding of the multiple representational states of binary information and the suite of translational occurrences that comprise interacting with digital information. You will also get a better understanding of file formats and embedded metadata.

* We will gain an understanding of the nature of file fixity and checksums, fixity audits, metadata extraction, and format characterization and validation tools and processes.

### Our overall agenda:

* Introduction
* Discussion: Assignment 1
* Talk: The Organizational Life of Digital Preservation
* Exercise: digital preservation assessment tools
* Talk: Bit Level
* Exercise: understanding bits, representation, and fixity
* Talk: Logical/Conceptual Objects
* Exercise: understanding formats and metadata 
* Discussion: Lab 2, Assignment 3, open discussion

Come ready to ask questions, learn new tools and concepts, and engage in open discussion about how specific digital preservation actions and technologies relate to both your SWG topics and some of the overall themes of the course.

**The good news:** SIS IT has installed many of the tools we will be using on the lab computers.  
**The bad new:** SIS IT could not get some of the tools to run on the lab computers.

Thus, I encourage people to bring their own laptops and to download some/all of the below applications beforehand. I will attempt to bridge the Mac/Windows divide during class (we'll see how that goes).
