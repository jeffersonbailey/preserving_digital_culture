# Lab 2 Preview

Hello! For Lab 2 we will be exploring additional digital preservation activities and tools. Unfortunately, Pitt IT services has been unable or unwilling to install some of the tools and platforms we will be working with in our exercises. There's, like, a lesson here regarding digital preservation.

Because of that, I strongly encourage everyone to bring their own computer, if possible, and to download the below software beforehand (especially Bitcurator and VirtualBox), if you want to follow along -- Bitcurator is a very large download (7+GB) so please make sure you have hard drive space beforehand and time to download and install before class if you want to follow along on your personal laptop. If you cannot bring a laptop to class, or have trouble installing any of the below, don't worry, I will be demonstrating everything on the projector and will make exercise instructions available afterwards for you to do the exercises on your own time and at your own computer.

## Software to download:

* Bitcurator
 * Main page: http://wiki.bitcurator.net/index.php?title=Main_Page
 * Installation: http://wiki.bitcurator.net/index.php?title=BitCurator_Virtual_Machine_Install
 * To run Bitcurator on your computer, you will need to run it in a virtual machine (VM) using VirtualBox, a free VM platform. Thus you will need to install VirtualBox and Bitcurator. See the installation link above for a step-by-step guide. Bitcurator requires quite a lot of hard-drive space and computing power. The compressed file for download is ~2.5GB and, uncompressed, is ~7.5GB. Be sure you have enough hard drive space to download and run Bitcurator and VirtualBox. If you don't have space or have issues with installation, don't worry, you will still be able to follow along by watching in class and I will make the exercises available afterwards.

* FTK Imager (Windows only) - Only download if you do not or cannot download Bitcurator
http://www.accessdata.com/support/product-downloads
 * If you cannot download/install Bitcurator, a free Windows disk imaging tool is FTK Imager. This piece of software is part of the overall FTK Toolkit package (which isn't free), a popular forensic analysis environment. You will need to register an email address to download FTK Imager (feel free to skip this if you can get Bitcurator working or don't want to register). A pre-created disk image will also be made available for classroom use.

* Bagger
 * http://sourceforge.net/projects/loc-xferutils/files/loc-bagger/2.1.3/
 * Bagger is the GUI interface to the Bag-It specification for digital content transfer. We will use Bagger to package up digital content for transfer to a digital preservation system.

* Text Editor
 * We will be working with XML files a bit, so it may be useful to have a text editor that displays structured documents and semantic highlighting. Two free ones are:
 * Notepad++ (Windows): http://notepad-plus-plus.org/
 * TextWrangler (Mac): http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/
 * There are multiple not-free text editors such as OxygenXML, Sublime Text, and related software such as Dreamweaver. Browsers will display structured documents though not allow you to edit them.

## Our general agenda for tomorrow will be:

* Final assignment discussion and Q&A
* OAIS / TRAC overview/review
* Acquisition & Forensics (Bitcurator)
* MODS (online tool)
* Packaging content (Bagger)
* Making SIPs (Archivematica)
* AIPs, DIPs - discussion and online examples
* PREMIS - overview and simple exercise
* Recap and Q&A
